KenBurning Slider 0.20
======================
A simple Ken Burns effect image slider based on jQuery library.

This plugin is under early development ;)

Of course, feel free to pull, fork, branch, crunch, smack, rush, and all the awesome git stuff.

Usage
=====
Download files or clone this repository.

Include CSS between your `<head></head>` tags, like this:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/kenburning.css" type="text/css" />
```

Put your images on any container with any ID and in-line style for the `height`. By the moment, `<img>` tags should be directly under the container, like this:
```
<div id="my-container" style="height: 350px;">
  <img src="img/pic-001.jpg" alt="" />
  <img src="img/pic-002.jpg" alt="" />
  <img src="img/pic-003.jpg" alt="" />
  <img src="img/pic-004.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
```

Include jQuery library by downloading it or by linking a CDN, then the `.js` and call the plugin, like this:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/kenburning.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
	$("#my-container").kenBurning({
		zoom : 1.25, // zoom multiplier (1.25x)
		time : 6000 // transition length (miliseconds)
	});
</script>
```

Take a look at `demo.html` for a basic implementation sample.
